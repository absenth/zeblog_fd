## Requirements

### Contest Requirements
1. Logs must be submitted in [Cabrillo Format](http://www.arrl.org/cabrillo-format-tutorial)
   * [Example Cabrillo Log](https://a2a53e2b-2285-4083-9cff-c99fe5ba1658.filesusr.com/ugd/1c7085_6e6ab52ed6a246558704199c09aaf9f7.pdf)
2. Interface should only accept fields we're logging
   * BAND (ie. 20M)
   * MODE (ie. Phone)
   * DATE (2021-06-28)
   * TIME (0900)
   * OUR CALL (W1AW)
   * OUR CATEGORY (1A)
   * OUR SECTION (STX)
   * HIS CALL (K9OOK)
   * HIS CATEGORY  (1B)
   * HIS SECTION (IN)
3. DATE & TIME should pull from the system, at the time we hit submit.
4. There Should be a Setup that lets us set one time Contest Data.

### Project Requirements
1. Power Loss of the Laptop should not result in losing logs.
2. Design for future multi-station logs (ie. one log, multiple computers)
3. Detect and Alert on Dupes (Same Callsign/Mode/Band)
4. It would be nice if we could pull BAND/Frequency data from the Rig.
